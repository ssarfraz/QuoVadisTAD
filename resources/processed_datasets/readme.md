# Datasets
We use the following multivariate and univariate datasets, see the paper for more details.


## SMD Datasets

This multivariate dataset is taken as is from https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OmniAnomaly

## SWaT and WADI Datasets

The industrial SWaT and WADI multivariate datasets belong to [iTRUST](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/). 

The application of data access and the details of the datasets can be found at [iTrust here](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/#wadi)

For consistant benchmarking and reference, We include only the extracted features used in our benchmarks without the orignal dataset and meta data. Please complete the iTrust access form before use.


## UCR/InternalBleeding Datasets

These univariate datasets are taken as is from https://compete.hexagon-ml.com/practice/competition/39/ 

We include the four InternalBleeding datasets.

## SMAP and MSL Datasets
These multivariate datasets are collected from a spacecraft of NASA.
