** SwaT and WADI Datasets

The SWaT and WADI datasets belong to [iTRUST](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/). 

The application of data access and the details of the datasets can be found at [iTrust here](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/#wadi)

For consistant benchmarking and reference, We include only the extracted features used in our benchmarks without the orignal dataset and meta data. Please complete the iTrust access form before use.


** UCR/InternalBleeding Dataset

This dataset is taken as is from https://compete.hexagon-ml.com/practice/competition/39/ 

We include the four InternalBleeding datasets.
